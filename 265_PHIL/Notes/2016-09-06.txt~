History of Science
	-Can evaluate philosophical claims about science by comparing them against 
	key episodes in history of science
	
Science vs. Non-Science
	-Understanding, explaining, and predicting (science)
		->These three functions help compose 'science'
	-The difference between non-science predicition is the scientific method
	
Scientific Method:
	-Theory/hypothetis -> experiment/observation -> confirmation/disconfiermation
	-"Science is _derived_ from the _facts_".

Scientific Method vs. Authorities
	-During middle ages, scholasticism consisted mainly in the understanding
	of texts by 'authorities' (Aristotle, Galen)
	
Scientific Revolution
	-1550-1700
	-Natural Philosophy (natural sciences) had critical attitude towards
	'given' views
	-Began gaining knowledge through experiment and observation
	
	-Began the school of thought _Empiricism_.
		-Different from _Rationalism_.
		-beliefs are justified by sense experience
		-"The only thing that justifies our beliefs is observation and experiment"
		-Collect observations, make general statement -> This is a _theory_.
		
Naive Empiricism
	-Fancis Bacon - you don't need anything special, just go and observe
	-Step 1: collect as much observation data as possible without prior assumptions.
	-Step 2: use induction to derive laws and theories.
	
Theory-Guided Empiricism
	-Observe and extrapolate an idea, then begin applying idea
		-> Origins of experimentation
	-Have to have some theories/ideas which lead your observation.
	-Scientific Knowledge -> Reasoning -> Facts - Observation -> Sense Experience
	
Facts
	-Facts are given to careful, unprejudiced observes via the senses
	-Prior and independent to theory
	-Constitute a firm and reliable foundation for scientific knowledge
	-THESE ARE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
	
	-External objects -> perceptual experience -> observation statements
	
	Perceptual Experience
		-Determined by factors from outside AND inside - knowledge, experience,
		training, etc.
		-To express a given perceptual experience you need
			->Conceptual framework
			->Names of objects
			->Terms for properties
			
	Vs. Theories
		-Observation statements are theory dependant
		-Facts are only as true as the observational statements - therefore,
		some observational statements may be false and undermine facts.
