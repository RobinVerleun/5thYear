Explainin Scientific Explanation

Explanandum: event to be explained
Explanans: What is intended to provide explanation

Differing Models: Covering law model, unification model, causal model

The Covering Law Model:
	- If you can give an argument, if the argument is valid (deductive or
	inductive), and within the premises there is a law (statement of a law of 
	nature). 
	
	-Symmetry thesis: each argument gives you both prediction and explanation
	
	-Deduction
		-> Valid
		-> Invalid
	-Induction
		-> Strong
		-> Weak
		
	-Has two sets of problems:
		->Concerning Symmetry thesis
			-Some good pexplanations are not predictions
			-Some good predictions are not explanations
		->Concerning the way scientific explanation is modeled
			-irrelevance
				
The Unification Model
	Explanation = Derivation (Explanation = Systematic Unification)
	-Explanation is not just formulas and arguments - it is a parameter
	used to evaluate theories.
	
	-If a set of beliefs in a field is K, the explanations for K known as E(K)
	 is the set of arguments that best unify K.
