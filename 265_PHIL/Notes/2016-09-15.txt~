-Induction: Deriving theories from the facts? (Chalmers Chp. 4)

-Reasoning is either deductive (formal reasoning) or _inductive_
	-Inductive: statistical syllogism, enumerative induction, IBE, etc.
	-Includes ALL non-deductive reasoning.
	
The Inductive Approach To Science
	-How can scientific knowledge be derived from the facts?
		-Are facts temporally prior to theories?
		-Do facts logically entail theories? (Derived from the facts)
		
	-Deductive Arguments
		-Modus Ponens: if A -> B			if A -> B
						  A					   B     
						----------    not  --------------
						       B			   A (This is false)
						       
						                   	
		-Modus Tolens: if A -> B
							~ B
					  ---------------
					  	~A		
		
		-Hypothetical Syllogism:  if A -> B
								 	 B -> C
								 ------------
								     A -> C
		
		-Disjunctive Syllogism: if A or B
								  ~A
							---------------
									ther. B
									
	-Good Inductive Arguments
		-We need principles of inference that are reliable. What makes it reliable?
			-Three Conditions:
				1) The number of observations forming the base generalization
				   must be large.
				2) The obervsation must be repeated under wide variety of conditions.
				   This helps to excluse accidental conditions.
				3) 
				
	-Inductive Method:
		Step 1) : To provide a theory through a generalization over observation
					statements.
		Step 2) : To provide explanations and predictions using theories
					Laws & Theories
				  + Initial Conditions
				  = Predictions and explanations
				  
	
	- Facts aquired through observation --> Induction = Laws and theories 
		--> Deducution = Prediction and explanation  
		
	-Problems of Induction
		-1) Problems formulating induction. Condition 1: How many observations?
		Condition 2: What kind of variety? Condition 3: No exceptions?
		-2) Problem of justification of induction. Deductive/Inductive justification?
		Chalmers: The first problem is significant
		Popper: The second problem is crucial.
