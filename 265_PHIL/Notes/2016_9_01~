PHIL 265 : "Philosophy of Science"
Professor: Hassan

What is Science?
	-Chemistry, Physics, Math...
	-Theory + Model
	-Understanding the world through evidence (experiments based on observation)
	-Leads to discovery + confirmation of the thoery
	-Science is a PROCESS
	
What is Special about Science?
	-Universal, objective (replication, measurement, quantities)
	-Has a set of rules: 
		-the Scientific Method 
		-Precise Concepts
	-Premise + Conclusions = Argument

What is Philosophy?
	-Main difference is in the questions we ask - PHIL is more general
	-Can ask questions that are 'outside' the physical world (non Empirical)
	-Pure:
		-Metaphysics(Reality meets existence)
		-Epistemology(Knowledge)
		-Axiology(Values)
		-Methodology
		
The Study of Science
	-Is scientific knowledge better?
	-How/to what extent does science arrive at valid knowledge?
	-What is the scientific method?
	-What is a law of nature?
	-Way to gaurentee valid knowledge?
	-What is objectivity?
	-Are observations interpreted differently?
	-Does knowledge grow in a progressive fashion?
	-Structure of scientific theory?
	-Is there a unity of all sciences?
	-Can we find a logic of discovery, or only justification?
	
Descriptive vs. Normative
	-Descrptive: does phil. avoid assigning values to science, and just describes how science works
	-Normative: does phil. attempt to judge science and assign values, to help clarify and distinguish
				from psuedoscience?
