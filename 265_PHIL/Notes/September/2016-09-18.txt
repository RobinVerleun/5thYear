Problems of Induction
we don’t have justification for induction
Everything is based on induction/inductive knowledge
we don’t know how to prove induction
ex no proof that the door knob will turn in the future because it turns now
Karl Popper (1902 –1994)
Revolutionary idea of faulsificationism
if we can find way to explain the idea of deductive argumentation, everything would be good
Popper against Inductivism
cannot use a probabilistic statements
carnap thought you could have probability logic, and could apply a probability number
3/6 of rolling an odd number on a dice
50% probability
all metals expand when heated
infinite metals
0% probability
if we cannot use induction, how do scientists find explanation
guess that this is true - then we observe
if observation contradicts statement, it is false
you cannot prove anything with examples but you can reject it
ex. all prime numbers are odd
not true - 2 is a prime number
if you cannot falsify something it is not scientific
The Logic Behind Faulsificationism 
Popper has a prescriptive account of science
a method a scientist has to follow
must give theories and give counter examples and falsify them
Hypothesis
Create many hypothesis to go through falsification
the best theories survive
Faulsificationism
descriptive account of how science works and a prescriptive about of how scientists should work
probability of some theories is higher than others the more you try to falsify them
Poppers three examples
Popper developed falsificationism as part of a critique of certain approaches that he deemed unscientific as they can seemingly interpret any observation as consistent with the theory (so that they are unfalsifiable):
Marxist theory of history
we had 4 stages of history
theory that capitalism is not stable
prediction - within 30 years a proletariat society will happen
not borne out
nothing can reject their theories - can defend any falsification
not scientific - not falsifiable
metaphysical theory
Freud’s psychoanalysis
Can explain everything in terms of odious complex
nothing can happen to reject their theory
artist - repression of emotions, etc.
theory is snot sensitive to the facts
Adler’s psychology
motivation for everything is sense of inferiority
no possibility to falsify
Demarcation Problem
Astrology is not science because it is not falsifiable
Logical Strength
everyone in class is 16 y/o 
40 falsifier for this statement
everyone in the university is 16y/o 
1000’s of falsifiers for this statement
Galileo Galilie (student presentaion)
born in pisa italy
influenced by father - famous musical theorist
learned value of well measured and qualified experimentation and scepticism for authority
studied natural philosophy and mathematics
"Father of observational astronomy, modern physics and the scientific method" - Stephen Hawkins
Used exterminations as a research tool
presented ideas through mathematical demonstrations
inductive reasoning
contributed ti eventual separation of science from religion
heliocentric model
law of motion
