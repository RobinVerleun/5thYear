Limits of Falsificqationism
	->Logic Problems
	->Unable to determine bad from good theories
	->Inadequate account of history

	Example:
		Water = H20
		T -> O
		~O
	---------------
	therf. ~T

Observation Statements:
	->Theory dependent and fallible
	->Different ppl, different observations based on background

	 ->Measurements and observations are imprecise
	 ->If value does not match predicted, not allowed to reject hypothesis

	 ->Falsification is too permissive or too narrow 
	 	-> Widely generic statements allow too much to get through
