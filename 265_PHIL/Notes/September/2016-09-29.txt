SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION
	-Explanation = Prediction
	-Prediction is not important

	Theories use EXPLANATION and PREDICTION

	To evaluate theories,
		-Explanatory Power
		-Predictive Power


Hempel's Symmetry Thesis
	-Both explanation and prediction have the same structure
	-"Any rationally acceptable answer to the question "Why did X occur?" must offer
	information which shows that X was to be expected - if not definitely, then at least with
	reasonable certainty."
	-Good explanations must help to show what is going on
	-No accidental generalization

Principle of Unity of Nature
	-Past observation says nothing about the future, unless you add premise to it
	"Nature behaves in a certain way"

Popper
	Theory T -> Observation O
				(Eg, F = ma (T)
	~O
	-----------------------------
	~T

	-Can never say theories are true or even probable - inductive logic has no place


Falsificationism:
	Explanation
		-Same as inductivism
		-Can use corroborates theories as premises
	Prediction
		-Step in the procedure of 'conjectures and refutations'
		-For practicle purposes?

Predictive Power:
	Inductivism offers a great account of prediction
	How about falsificationism?
	Salm: "a serious dilemma"

		Popper: Scientific reasoning is purely deductive - but we can still gain basis for predictions

		Problems with Induction:
			Characterizing: Which conditions give good inference
			Justification: any way gives circular reasoning
			Psychology: without logical grounds, why would people rely on it
			Practical: Which one is more reliable

Falsificationism is based on the logical point
	-A single counterexample can refute a generalization


Predictive Arguments
	-General statement, singular (observational) statement(s)
	- General + O1 [+ 02, + 03...] = Future Example
		-General must refer to the future as well, observations are based on the past
