Section 1: From Beginning to End - An Overview of Systems Analysis and Design

	Objective 1: Page 4-5, Review Questions 1-3 (Page 28), Supplementary Readings
	
	-An information system is a set of intwined computer components that collect, process, store, and provides
	 information needed for business tasks.
	-Systems Analyst: someone who acts as the bridge between the demands (customer) and programmer.
	-SA&D includes soft and hard skills.
	-System Analysis: activities which enable a person to understand what a new system should accomplish.
	-System Design: described 'how' the system will work.
	
	-SDLC is composed of six core processes required in making a new application:
		1. Identify the problem or need, obtain approval.
		2. Plan and monitor the project.
		3. Discover and understand the details of the problem.
		4. Design the system components that solve the problem.
		5. Build, test, and integrate components.
		6. Complete tests and deploy.

		Identify, Plan the work, Discover the issues, Design the parts, Test the parts, Deploy Solution
	
	-Agile Development: Information System Dev. process emphasizing flexibility.
	-Key element of iterative development: choose solution parts that can be done in two or four weeks.
